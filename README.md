## Objective
Drive as long and far as you can! 

## Setup
Start with 2 Blinks, place them together, then place a third Blink attached to one of the red dots. You have now chosen a direction, continue to add them onto the place where the red dot shows up. Once you have placed all of your Blinks, press the first one at the end you started from. The car will start racing towards the end.

To reset the game, simply separate the Blinks, they will turn Yellow and be ready for a new game.

## Gameplay
Once the car has left a Blink, you can remove it and then place it at the end the car is racing towards. Keep providing road ahead, the car gets faster each time it revisits a Blink it has seen before. Get your Blinks into a perfect loop and you win...
